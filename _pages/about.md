  I'm a Brazilian scientist, born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, currently living in Berlin. I got a bachelor degree in Biomedicine from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro State ([UNIRIO](http://www.unirio.br/)) in 2007, and a Masters in Cellular and Molecular Biology from Oswaldo Cruz Foundation ([FIOCRUZ](https://portal.fiocruz.br/en)) in 2010. In 2014 I got my doctorate degree in Computational and System Biology from Oswaldo Cruz Foundation ([FIOCRUZ](https://portal.fiocruz.br/en)). During my doctorate I witnessed the growth of Next Generating Sequencing (NGS), working with sequenced ocean metagenomes (pyrosequencing) and studying the potential of secondary metabolism of aquatic microorganisms.
  
  In 2015 I was granted with an international postdoc fellowship and moved to Berlin, where I worked at the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries ([IGB](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en)), in collaboration with The Berlin Center for Genomics in Biodiversity Research ([BeGenDiv](https://begendiv.de/])). 
  
  In 2017 I moved to Cologne, where I worked at the bioinformatics core facility from the Max Plank Institute for Biology of Ageing ([MPI-AGE](https://www.age.mpg.de/)) for 2 years. 
  
  From 2019 to 2020 I worked at the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rebrucke ([DIfE](http://www.dife.de/)) in the Department of Molecular Epidemiology (MEP), trying to better understand the influence of the gut microbiome on cardiometabolic diseases on EPIC-POTSDAM cohort study. I’m involved in several projects from the department but also external collaborations and side projects, including the study of the antibiotic resistome in oceans ([ResistomeDB](https://resistomedb.com/)) and in the human microbiome (work in progress). I'm also investigating the influence of the nasopharyngeal microbiome in the severity of COVID-19.  
  
  From December of 2020 to May 2021 I worked as Bioinformatics Scientis in the Bioinformatics and Omics Data Science group from the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology (BIMSB) at Max Delbrück Center (MDC).
  
  From 2021 to 2022 I worked at Eagle Genomics as Senior System Biologists and Scientific lead for several projects on the microbiome space. Currently I'm a Principal Sciencist at mbiomics, where we are creating a new live bacteria therapeutics.  
  
  Since my bachelor thesis, studying parasite protozoa genomes, I always had a passion for the microbiological world and its relation to human health.

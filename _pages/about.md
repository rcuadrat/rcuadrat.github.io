I'm a Brazilian scientist, born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, currently living in Berlin. I got a bachelor degree in Biomedicine from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro State ([UNIRIO](http://www.unirio.br/)) in 2007, and a Masters in Cellular and Molecular Biology from Oswaldo Cruz Foundation ([FIOCRUZ](https://portal.fiocruz.br/en)) in 2010. In 2014 I got my doctorate degree in Computational and System Biology from Oswaldo Cruz Foundation ([FIOCRUZ](https://portal.fiocruz.br/en)). During my doctorate I witnessed the growth of Next Generating Sequencing (NGS), working with 454 sequenced ocean metagenomes and studying the potential of secondary metabolism of aquatic microorganisms. In 2015 I was granted with an international postdoc fellowship and moved to Berlin, where I worked at the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries ([IGB](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en)), in collaboration with The Berlin Center for Genomics in Biodiversity Research ([BeGenDiv](https://begendiv.de/])). In 2017 I moved to Cologne, where I worked at the bioinformatics core facility from the Max Plank Institute for Biology of Ageing ([MPI-AGE](https://www.age.mpg.de/)) for 2 years. Since 2019 I have a postdoc position at the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rebrucke ([DIfE](http://www.dife.de/)) in the Department of Molecular Epidemiology (MEP). Currently I’m trying to better understand the influence of the gut microbiome on cardiometabolic diseases on EPIC-POTSDAM cohort study. I’m involved in several projects from our department but also external collaborations, including the study of the antibiotic resistome in oceans ([ResistomeDB](https://resistomedb.com/)) and also in the human microbiome. Since my bachelor thesis, studying parasite protozoa genomes, I always had a passion for the microbiological world and its relation to human health.
